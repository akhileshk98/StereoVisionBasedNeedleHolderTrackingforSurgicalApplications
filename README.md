# 3D Pose estimation of a  Surgical Needle Holder

## Target Localization:
Accurately tracking the needle holder tip allows surgeons to precisely locate and target specific anatomical structures or points of interest within the patient's body.

## Instrument Guidance: 
Provides real-time feedback on the position and orientation of surgical instruments, ensuring they are correctly positioned relative to the surgical target.

## Accuracy :
3D tracking ensures precise navigation of surgical instruments to target locations, enabling autonomous systems to execute tasks with a higher level of accuracy than manual operations alone.

## Results :
The trajectory of the needle holder tip has been tracked and the 3D World coordinates keeping the yellow marker as origin has been annotated.
